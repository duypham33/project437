# **Project: Image Retrieval**

* Course: CPT_S 437
* Student: Duy Pham
* Washington State University

## Stages:

There are 3 main files: **Data Crawler.ipynb**, **Training.ipynb**, and **ImageRetrieval-CNN-Cosine.ipynb**.

The order is important:
* **Data Crawler.ipynb**: for scraping data and store the dataset (Milestone 1)
* **Training.ipynb**: train a CNN model from the dataset (Milestone 2)
* **ImageRetrieval-CNN-Cosine.ipynb**: use the model for the application, model tuning, and evaluation (Final Milestone)

## Guidelines:

The following shows how to run these three files in Google Colab:

1) In your Google Drive, create a folder named **Image Retrieval**, then upload the **Training.ipynb** and **ImageRetrieval-CNN-Cosine.ipynb** files in this folder.
2) In this **Image Retrieval** folder, create a folder named **Database**, and upload **Data Crawler.ipynb** file into this folder
3) Run the files:
* In fact, you should only run the **ImageRetrieval-CNN-Cosine.ipynb** file, because the two other files are at the first two Milestones when we were collecting and storing dataset, and then training! That costs a lot of time to run. But in case you would like run the entire project, just run every cells in order in the three files in their correct order mentioned above!
